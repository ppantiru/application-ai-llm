# XWiki AI

This is a fork of the main work done on https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/ai-llm
I use it to test experimental ideas.
For the stable version go to the main [xwiki-contrib/aillm repo](https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/ai-llm)

This project aims to integrate artificial intelligence currently in the form of Large Language Models (LLMs)
into the XWiki platform as an installable extension.
You can find more details about the general plan in the
[design documentation](https://design.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Proposal/X-AI/).
